    <h1>Emissions Analysis of Rocket Fuels</h1>
    <p>Different types of rocket fuels produce different levels of emissions, which is really important to understand. For example, kerosene is a common rocket fuel, but it can release a lot of carbon dioxide and soot into the atmosphere. This can negatively impact air quality and contribute to climate change, which is not good for our planet.

On the flip side, liquid hydrogen is a cleaner fuel option, producing mostly water vapor when burned. However, making liquid hydrogen requires a lot of energy, and that energy often comes from sources that can create emissions too. So even though it’s cleaner when used, the process of making it can still have an environmental impact.

Right now, rockets are estimated to use around 10 million tons of fuel each year! To help you picture just how much that is, think about the Statue of Liberty, which weighs about 225 tons. That means the total amount of rocket fuel is roughly equivalent to the weight of 44,444 Statues of Liberty stacked on top of each other! That's an enormous amount, and it really shows why we need to find better, more sustainable ways to fuel our space adventures. By doing this, we can explore the stars while keeping our planet safe and healthy!</p>
