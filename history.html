    <h1>Historical Context of Rocket Fuels</h1>
    <p>Since the dawn of space exploration in the 20th century, rockets have relied heavily on various fuels. Since people started exploring space, rockets have used different kinds of fuel, and each type can affect the environment in its own way. Some fuels are cleaner and produce less pollution, while others can create harmful gases that hurt our air and climate. As we learn more about space travel, it's important to find better fuels that won’t damage our planet. By understanding the effects of these fuels, we can make smarter choices for a cleaner future in space exploration!</p>
