    <h1>Environmental Impact of Rocket Emissions</h1>
    <p>Rocket emissions contribute to atmospheric pollution, especially in the upper atmosphere, where they can have even more significant impacts. These emissions can lead to ozone depletion, which is concerning because the ozone layer protects us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Additionally, the pollutants released by rockets can contribute to climate change, further raising alarms among scientists and environmentalists.

As rockets ascend, they release various particles and gases that can alter the delicate balance of our atmosphere. This not only affects air quality but also has long-term consequences for weather patterns and ecosystems on Earth. With growing concerns about the environment, it's crucial for the space industry to explore cleaner fuel alternatives and technologies that minimize these harmful effects.

By prioritizing sustainability in space exploration, we can continue to reach for new horizons while protecting our planet for future generations.</p>
