    <h1>Types of Fuels Used in Space Exploration</h1>
    <p>Rockets utilize various types of fuels, each with its own advantages and environmental impacts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Liquid Hydrogen:</strong> A clean fuel that produces water vapor as a byproduct.</li>
        <li><strong>Kerosene:</strong> Commonly used in early rockets; emits CO₂ and other pollutants.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypergolic Fuels:</strong> Ignite on contact, releasing toxic byproducts.</li>
        <li><strong>Solid Fuels:</strong> Used in boosters; burn quickly but can produce significant emissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rockets use different types of fuels, and each one has its own benefits and effects on the environment. Some fuels are super efficient and help rockets launch quickly, while others are cleaner and produce less pollution. However, certain fuels can create harmful emissions that affect our air and climate. By learning about these different fuels, we can choose the best options that keep our space missions exciting while also protecting our planet!</p>
