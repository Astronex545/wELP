    <h1>Innovations in Space Exploration</h1>
    <p>Rocket emissions contribute to atmospheric pollution, especially in the upper atmosphere, where they can lead to ozone depletion and climate change. This raises concerns among scientists and environmentalists about the long-term impacts on air quality and ecosystems.

To tackle these issues, many space agencies, like NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are researching cleaner technologies. Innovations such as electric propulsion and biofuels aim to reduce emissions in space travel. These advancements could make space exploration more sustainable and environmentally friendly, giving you the chance to touch the stars while protecting our planet!</p>
