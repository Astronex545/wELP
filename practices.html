    <h1>Current Practices in Space Travel</h1>
    <p>Rocket emissions contribute to atmospheric pollution, especially in the upper atmosphere, where they can have even more significant impacts. These emissions can lead to ozone depletion, which is concerning because the ozone layer protects us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Additionally, the pollutants released by rockets can contribute to climate change, raising alarms among scientists and environmentalists.

As rockets ascend, they release various particles and gases that can alter the delicate balance of our atmosphere. This not only affects air quality but also has long-term consequences for weather patterns and ecosystems on Earth. With growing concerns about the environment, it's crucial for the space industry to explore cleaner fuel alternatives and technologies that minimize these harmful effects.

Many space agencies are currently researching and implementing cleaner technologies to address these issues. For example, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are actively exploring alternative fuels and more efficient propulsion systems. Their goal is to minimize ecological footprints while continuing their exciting exploration efforts.

By prioritizing sustainability in space missions, these organizations hope to reduce their impact on the environment. This way, we can keep pushing the boundaries of space exploration without compromising the health of our planet. The future of space travel can be both thrilling and responsible, ensuring that we protect our Earth for generations to come.</p>
